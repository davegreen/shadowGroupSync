shadowGroupSync
====================

Description
---------------------

A PowerShell script that provides an easy way to manage Active Directory shadow groups. 
This script requires the [PowerShell Active Directory module](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee617195.aspx) from Microsoft.

### Features

- Sync user or computer objects from one or more OUs to a single group.
- Ability to filter objects included in the shadow group using the [PowerShell Active Directory Filter](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh531527).
- Ability to choose shadow group type (Security/Distribution).

Setting Up
---------------------

### Installing the Active Directory PowerShell Module

If you plan to run this script on a Server 2008R2 or Server 2012 Domain Controller, the Active Directory PowerShell module should already be installed.

Alternatively, if you wish to run this script from a Server 2008R2 or Server 2012 member server, you will need to install the AD-PowerShell module first. To do this, run PowerShell as an Administrator, then run the following commands:

> Import-Module ServerManager

> Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell

If you are running Windows 7, the module can be installed with the [Microsoft Remote Server Administration Tools For Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7887). 
You will then need to enable it from:

> Control Panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows Features On or Off

You can also use the Add-WindowsFeature cmdlet as shown above.

With Windows 8, installing the [Microsoft Remote Server Administration Tools For Windows 8](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=28972) is enough, as all of the features are automatically enabled when the update is installed.

### [Enabling scripts in PowerShell](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849812.aspx)

By default, PowerShell will not let you run scripts and will only work in interactive mode. In order to run the shadowGroupSync script from a local drive, you will need to alter this behaviour. To do this, run PowerShell as an Administrator, then run the following command:

> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

This will allow scripts that are stored locally and not signed by a trusted publisher to be run.

### Creating the CSV

Once you have downloaded the script, you will need to create the CSV file where you specify the shadow groups you want to create. Here is a sample CSV file:

> Domain,ObjType,SourceOU,DestOU,GroupName,GroupType,Recurse
> "contoso.com","computer","OU=A1,OU=A_Block,OU=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com","OU=ShadowGroups,DC=contoso,DC=com","Block-A1","Security","SubTree"
> "contoso.com","computer","OU=A2,OU=A_Block,OU=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com","OU=ShadowGroups,DC=contoso,DC=com","Block-A2","Security","SubTree"
> "contoso.com","computer","OU=A1,OU=A_Block,OU=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com;OU=A2,OU=A_Block,OU=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=com","OU=ShadowGroups,DC=contoso,DC=com","Block-A1-A2","Security","OneLevel"
> "contoso.com","user","OU=A1Users,OU=Users,DC=contoso,DC=com","OU=ShadowGroups,DC=contoso,DC=com","Users-A1","Distribution","SubTree"
> "child.contoso.com","user-mail-enabled","OU=A2Users,DC=child,DC=contoso,DC=com","OU=ShadowGroups,DC=contoso,DC=com","Users-A2","Distribution","OneLevel"

- Domain specifies the domain to query for the source AD objects.
- ObjType is a query type that can be specified in the script to filter for objects. This can be easily extended in the script.
- SourceOU is the OU (or OUs, separated by a semicolon) to query for source objects for the shadow group.
- DestOU is the OU where you would like the shadow group to be created.
- GroupName specifies the name of the shadow group.
- GroupType specifies whether a Security or Distribution group will be created. The default is Security.
- Recurse specifies how to search the SourceOU for objects. [This can be "OneLevel" or "SubTree"](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee617241.aspx).

You can place the CSV file anywhere on the system, as long as the script can be told where to find it.

Usage
---------------------

You can run the script in a couple of ways. In most production environments, you can use a scheduled task to run the script.

The following command will run the script and log the output to a specific directory.

> powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -command "%~dp0\shadowGroupSync.ps1 -file %~dp0\shadow-groups.csv" 2>&1 > %~dp0\shadowGroupSync.log"

If you want to run the script normally, you can call the PowerShell script either with or without the '-file' argument.

> ./shadowGroupSync.ps1 'C:\path\to\csv'

> ./shadowGroupSync.ps1 -file 'C:\path\to\csv'

### Recomendation

If running as a scheduled task, it is recommended to use a service account with limited privleges to the domain. The following steps should produce the desired results:

1. Create a service account (i.e. `svcShadowGroups`)
  * Set a secure password that does not expire
2. Add the account to a `Service Accounts` security group
3. Add the account to a `Group Operators` security group
  * Give this group `Create/Delete Groups` permission to desired areas
  * Also give `List, Read, Write, Delete` permission to `Descendant Groups`
4. Add Group Policy to relevant servers/computers to allow `Run as` permissions
  * Under `Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment`:
  * Configure `Logon as a batch job` and `Logon as a service` to include `Service Accounts`
  * It is also recommended to include Administrators and Backup Operators
5. Create a scheduled task on a server or computer
  * `Change User or Group` to service acconut
  * Run whether the user is logged on or not
  * Set triggers for desired schedule
  * Create an action to call .bat file

### Note
If you are using this script with child domains, you may need to change the GroupScope of created shadow groups to Universal.
